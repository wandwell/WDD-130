        <p>My family currently includes my husband, Cody and our dog Leo. I am currently a CNA and hope that pursuing my career will open the doors for me to either work from home or part time. This would allow me to be a stay at home mom when Cody and I have kids of our own.</p>
        <p>I have been a member of the Church all of my life and served a mission in Uruguay. My favorite scriptrue is currently 1 Nephi 10:19: "For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost..."</p>
